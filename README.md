# Agent Starter (Python)

An opinionated, batteries-included starter for building AI agents — from simple scripts to Telegram bots to small web apps. You clone it, point Claude Code at it, and build.

> **One clone = one project.** Starting a new agent? Clone a fresh copy.

## The True-Crime Detective

*Causae verae ex archivo* — real causes from the archive.

**What I'm building:** A single-player detective game built from genuine historical court
records. Each case is a real trial — Old Bailey, CourtListener, newspaper archives. You
examine evidence, question the record in natural language, name a culprit, then learn what
really happened.

**Who it's for:** People who find real historical crimes fascinating but find raw archives
inaccessible. The pitch: you're not playing a game — you're investigating a murder that
happened 150 years ago, using the actual trial transcript as your evidence file.

**What "done" looks like:** You receive a Telegram message — "🔎 A new case has crossed
your desk." You examine evidence items, ask the game master questions, and it answers
strictly from the trial record (never inventing facts). You make your accusation. The
bot reveals the real verdict and scores you against history.

## Quickstart

**Fork this repo first — don't work in the original.** On GitHub click **Fork**, then clone
*your* fork (if you clone the original, you won't be able to save and push your work):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/agent-starter-python.git
cd agent-starter-python
```

You also need [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed (it manages Python and dependencies). Then:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (uv reads the lockfile and sets up Python 3.12)
uv sync

# 2. Create your .env and add your keys
cp .env.example .env
#    open .env and fill in OPENROUTER_API_KEY (the others are optional)

# 3. Check everything is wired up
uv run agent-doctor

# 4. Run the example agent
uv run agent
```

`agent-doctor` prints your environment, which credentials are set, and whether the live services respond (it even enables `pgvector` if you've set a database). Green ticks mean you're ready.

## What's in the box

- **LLMs** via OpenRouter — pick a model by *tier* (`fast`, `balanced`, `smart`, `research`), plus embeddings and web research with sources.
- **Media** via fal.ai — generate images/audio/etc. with one call, optionally saved to your storage.
- **Storage** via Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible) — upload files, get durable links.
- **Database** via Neon Postgres — async, with a tiny built-in migration runner and `pgvector` for embeddings.
- **Logging** to console + `logs/agent.log`, a **doctor** to check your setup, and a clean **CLI** and **web** (FastAPI + HTMX + Tailwind) starting point.

Two runnable demos live in [`examples/`](examples/) — read them, run them, then delete them.
Each is a folder with its own `docs/` showing the method filled in for a real project:
- `examples/build_an_agent/` — a terminal app that suggests an agent for you to build.
- `examples/agent_idea_web/` — a small web app: research → write-up → diagram → saved & shareable.

## How you build (the method)

This starter is built around a specific way of working — think first, document as you go, build and test small pieces, then compose. The full method is in **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** (which also tells Claude how to help you), and each stage has a doc template in **[`docs/`](docs/)**. The single most important habit: keep **[`journal.md`](journal.md)** as you go.

## Common commands

```bash
uv run agent                  # run the example agent
uv run agent-doctor           # check your setup
uv run pytest                 # fast tests
uv run pytest -m integration  # live tests (need credentials)
uv run fastapi dev src/agent/web.py   # run the web app
```

## Configuration

All config is environment variables, loaded from `.env` (never commit it). See `.env.example` for every option. Only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is required; add the rest when a project needs media, storage, or a database.
